        <h1>About ELYSION</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>A fresh approach to property care</h2>
            <p>We started Elysion because we saw a gap - too many property services overpromise and underdeliver. So we built a business that's simple, reliable, and focused on doing the job properly.</p>
            <p>We're based in Auckland and offer everything from landscaping and garden maintenance to pressure washing, painting, and pre-sale tidy-ups. Whether you're a homeowner, landlord, or property manager, we make it easy to keep your property looking sharp.</p>
            <p><strong>No stress. No chasing tradies. Just one team that handles it all.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What we're about</h2>
            <p>We like things to look tidy, work properly, and last. That goes for gardens, paint jobs, fences - and how we run the business.</p>
            <p>We believe in keeping things straightforward: turn up on time, do solid work, communicate clearly, and don't cut corners. It's not complicated, but it makes a big difference.</p>
            <p>We're proud of the work we do, and we genuinely enjoy helping people get their properties looking how they should - clean, functional, and looked after.</p>

            <h2>How we work</h2>
            <p>We keep things professional but easy-going. You'll get honest advice, quick responses, and a job that's done right the first time. We show up when we say we will, treat your property with respect, and leave things looking better than we found them.</p>
            <p>Most of our clients stick with us - and we think that says it all.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to be the go-to name in Auckland for landscaping and property care. We're also developing a smart app to make booking and managing services even easier - whether you're a property manager with a portfolio or just want the lawns done without the hassle.</p>
            <p>We're always growing, but the way we work won't change: good people, quality results, and no shortcuts.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Part of the Community</h2>
            <p>We believe good businesses give back - not just in words, but in action. That's why we donate clean soil, mulch, and compost we generate from jobs to local community gardens and urban growing projects around Auckland.</p>
            <p>Instead of sending green waste to landfill, we put it to better use - helping support neighbourhood veggie patches and shared garden spaces.</p>
            <p>It's a small way we can contribute to something bigger, and it's part of how we work: practical, grounded, and always trying to do a bit better.</p>
            <p>If you run a local community garden or are part of a growing project that could use support, get in touch - we're always happy to help where we can.</p>

            <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
            <p><strong>Led by experience. Backed by good people.</strong></p>
            <p>Elysion is led by Jack Mines - a hands-on operator with years of experience in property services, landscape construction, and business management. Jack's been in the thick of it, from building decks and planting gardens to managing crews, quoting jobs, and handling clients directly.</p>
            <p>He started Elysion to create a business that does things the right way - not just ticking the box, but actually taking pride in the work and building lasting relationships with clients.</p>
            <blockquote>“I've worked in the industry long enough to know what clients get frustrated with - poor communication, messy work, people not showing up. So I built Elysion around doing the opposite of all that. We keep things clear, consistent, and professional.”</blockquote>
            <p>Jack now leads a growing team of skilled, reliable, and down-to-earth people who genuinely care about what they do. Whether it's a big landscaping project or regular maintenance, the aim is always the same: leave the place looking better than we found it.</p>
